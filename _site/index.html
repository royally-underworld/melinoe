            <h2>What Underworld is.</h2>
            <p>Underworld is a safe alternative play space without judgement, elitism, and bad attitudes.</p>
            <p>We’re run by a trio of strong, queer individuals who wanted to create a dark, alternative space with
                kink/fetish elements that runs monthly.
                Staffed by hard working volunteers from all different backgrounds, we take pride in being an inclusive,
                safe, and body positive environment.
                Come hang out with us, socialize, dance, or play! Our music is backed by dark electronic, pulsating
                aggro-tech, and industrial- sprinkled with some sexy pop tunes and we update it regularly.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
            <h1>The Space</h1>
            <p>We have an upstairs loft that features beautiful lighting setups, a booming sound system, DJ booth and
                multiple
                rooms for your enjoyment.</p>
            <p>The dungeon features a prison cell, cage, medical table, St Andrew's cross, and we have recently
                installed a
                hardpoint for rope suspension! We are also working on getting back our stripper pole.</p>
            <p>The red room features a layered cat tree of beds for fun activities.</p>
            <p>We have a dance floor and lounge area, a bar and a designated chill-out room for aftercare and taking a
                break.</p>

                <p>Please know that the volume level of the music has been picked as a medium between just loud enough
                    to hear throughout the venue and to dance to,
                    and low enough that it’s not too quiet that dancing is impossible. Everyone is different and has a
                    different threshold for volume.
                    What might be loud to you could be quiet to someone else. All playlists are curated specifically
                    for the current event and worked on for weeks to ensure the best songs are played for your
                    enjoyment.
                    If the music isn’t to your taste, that’s fine, each event has a different vibe and genre so the
                    next month might be more to your taste.
                    The day after the event, the Spotify playlist is always posted on the Facebook group. Feel free to
                    give it a follow if you liked it. If you want to know a specific song, use Siri, Shazam, or
                    SoundHound to find it on your phone, or if our DJ is at the booth, feel free to ask her which song
                    is currently playing.</p>
