                        <li>Inform the person that you are uncomfortable, and do not want to play with them, that you
                            do not want their attention, etc. </li>
                        <li>If they persist, tell them again and inform staff. You can find staff members by their <b

            <div class="answer">
                <p>We go by a <b>3 strike system</b>. Once you have had your three strikes, or you do something very
                    bad (for an immediate ban),
                    you will get <b>banned</b> and will no longer be able to attend Underworld. Rules are rules, not

                the music/I like this song, what is it??</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Please know that the volume level of the music has been picked as a medium between just loud enough
                    to hear throughout the venue and to dance to,
                    and low enough that it’s not too quiet that dancing is impossible. Everyone is different and has a
                    different threshold for volume.
                    What might be loud to you could be quiet to someone else. All playlists are curated specifically
                    for the current event and worked on for weeks to ensure the best songs are played for your
                    enjoyment.
                    If the music isn’t to your taste, that’s fine, each event has a different vibe and genre so the
                    next month might be more to your taste.
                    The day after the event, the Spotify playlist is always posted on the Facebook group. Feel free to
                    give it a follow if you liked it. If you want to know a specific song, use Siri, Shazam, or
                    SoundHound to find it on your phone, or if our DJ is at the booth, feel free to ask her which song
                    is currently playing.</p>
